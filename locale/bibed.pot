"The fields marked as ‘required’ are not strictly required in all cases. "
"The bibliography styles which come with this package can get by with as "
"little as a <span face=\"monospace\">title</span> field for most entry "
"types. A book published anonymously, a periodical without an explicit "
"editor, or a software manual without an explicit author should pose no "
"problem as far as the bibliography is concerned. Citation styles, "
"however, may 32have different requirements. For example, an author-year "
"citation scheme obviously requires an <span "
"face=\"monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\">editor</span> "
"and a <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> field. \n"
"\n"
"You may generally use the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field to "
"provide a substitute for any missing data required for citations. How the"
" <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field is employed depends on the "
"citation style. The author-year citation styles which come with this "
"package use the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field as a fallback"
" if either the <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>/<span "
"face=\"monospace\">editor</span> or the <span "
"face=\"monospace\">year</span> is missing. The numeric styles, on the "
"other hand, do not use it at all since the numeric scheme is independent "
"of the available data. The author-title styles ignore it as well, because"
" the bare <span face=\"monospace\">title</span> is usually sufficient to "
"form a unique citation and a title is expected to be available in any "
"case. The <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field may also be used to"
" override the non-numeric portion of the automatically generated <span "
"face=\"monospace\">labelalpha</span> field used by alphabetic citation "
"styles.  \n"
"\n"
"Note that traditional BibTeX styles support a <span "
"face=\"monospace\">key</span> field which is used for alphabetizing if "
"both <span face=\"monospace\">author</span> and <span "
"face=\"monospace\">editor</span> are missing. The biblatex package treats"
" <span face=\"monospace\">key</span> as an alias for <span "
"face=\"monospace\">sortkey</span>. In addition to that, it offers very "
"fine-grained sorting controls. Use the <span "
"face=\"monospace\">label</span> field as a fallback label for citations."
