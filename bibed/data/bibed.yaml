  missing_and_omissible_data:
    content: "The fields marked as \u2018required\u2019 are not strictly required\
      \ in all cases. The bibliography styles which come with this package\
      \ can get by with as little as a <span face=\"monospace\">title</span>\
      \ field for most entry types. A book published anonymously, a periodical\
      \ without an explicit editor, or a software manual without an explicit\
      \ author should pose no problem as far as the bibliography is concerned.\
      \ Citation styles, however, may 32have different requirements. For example,\
      \ an author-year citation scheme obviously requires an <span face=\"\
      monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\">editor</span> and\
      \ a <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> field. \n\nYou may generally\
      \ use the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field to provide a substitute\
      \ for any missing data required for citations. How the <span face=\"\
      monospace\">label</span> field is employed depends on the citation style.\
      \ The author-year citation styles which come with this package use the\
      \ <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field as a fallback if either\
      \ the <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\"\
      >editor</span> or the <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> is missing.\
      \ The numeric styles, on the other hand, do not use it at all since\
      \ the numeric scheme is independent of the available data. The author-title\
      \ styles ignore it as well, because the bare <span face=\"monospace\"\
      >title</span> is usually sufficient to form a unique citation and a\
      \ title is expected to be available in any case. The <span face=\"monospace\"\
      >label</span> field may also be used to override the non-numeric portion\
      \ of the automatically generated <span face=\"monospace\">labelalpha</span>\
      \ field used by alphabetic citation styles.  \n\nNote that traditional\
      \ BibTeX styles support a <span face=\"monospace\">key</span> field\
      \ which is used for alphabetizing if both <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>\
      \ and <span face=\"monospace\">editor</span> are missing. The biblatex\
      \ package treats <span face=\"monospace\">key</span> as an alias for\
      \ <span face=\"monospace\">sortkey</span>. In addition to that, it offers\
      \ very fine-grained sorting controls. Use the <span face=\"monospace\"\
      >label</span> field as a fallback label for citations."

    article: An article in a journal, magazine, newspaper, or other periodical
      which forms a self-contained unit with its own title. The title of the
      periodical is given in the <span face="monospace">journaltitle</span>
      field. If the issue has its own title in addition to the main title
      of the periodical, it goes in the <span face="monospace">issuetitle</span>
      field. Note that <span face="monospace">editor</span> and related fields
      refer to the journal while <span face="monospace">translator</span>
      and related fields refer to the article.
    artwork: Works of the visual arts such as paintings, sculpture, and installations.
    audio: Audio recordings, typically on audio cd, dvd, audio cassette, or
      similar media. See also <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@music</span>.
    bibnote: This special entry type is not meant to be used in the <span
      face="monospace">bib</span> file like other types. It is provided for
      third-party packages like <span face="monospace">notes2bib</span> which
      merge notes into the bibliography. The notes should go into the <span
      face="monospace">note</span> field. Be advised that the <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@bibnote</span> type is not related to the <span face="monospace">\defbibnote</span>
      command in any way. <span face="monospace">\defbibnote</span> is for
      adding comments at the beginning or the end of the bibliography, whereas
      the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@bibnote</span> type is meant
      for packages which render endnotes as bibliography entries.
    book: A single-volume book with one or more authors where the authors
      share credit for the work as a whole. This entry type also covers the
      function of the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      type of traditional <span face="monospace">BibTeX</span>.
    booklet: A book-like work without a formal publisher or sponsoring institution.
      Use the field <span face="monospace">howpublished</span> to supply publishing
      information in free format, if applicable. The field <span face="monospace">type</span>
      may be useful as well.
    collection: A single-volume collection with multiple, self-contained contributions
      by distinct authors which have their own title. The work as a whole
      has no overall author but it will usually have an editor.
    commentary: Commentaries which have a status different from regular books,
      such as legal commentaries.
    conference: A legacy alias for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inproceedings</span>.
    electronic: An alias for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@online</span>.
    image: Images, pictures, photographs, and similar media.
    inbook: Use the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span> entry
      type for a self-contained part of a book with its own title only. It
      relates to <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span> just like
      <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@incollection</span> relates to
      <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>. If you want
      to refer to a chapter or section of a book, simply use the book type
      and add a chapter and/or pages field. Whether a bibliography should
      at all include references to chapters or sections is controversial because
      a chapter is not a bibliographic entity.
    incollection: A contribution to a collection which forms a self-contained
      unit with a distinct author and title. The <span face="monospace">author</span>
      refers to the <span face="monospace">title</span>, the <span face="monospace">editor</span>
      to the <span face="monospace">booktitle</span>, i. e., the title of
      the collection.
    jurisdiction: Court decisions, court recordings, and similar things.
    legal: Legal documents such as treaties.
    legislation: Laws, bills, legislative proposals, and similar things.
    letter: Personal correspondence such as letters, emails, memoranda, etc.
    manual: Technical or other documentation, not necessarily in printed form.
      The <span face="monospace">author</span> or <span face="monospace">editor</span>
      is omissible in terms of @@@import{2.3.2}.
    misc: A fallback type for entries which do not fit into any other category.
      Use the field <span face="monospace">howpublished</span> to supply publishing
      information in free format, if applicable. The field type may be useful
      as well. <span face="monospace">author</span>, <span face="monospace">editor</span>,
      and <span face="monospace">year</span> are omissible in terms of @@@cite{defaults.fields.doc.missing_and_omissible_data}.
    movie: Motion pictures. See also <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@video</span>.
    music: Musical recordings. This is a more specific variant of <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@audio</span>.
    mvbook: A multi-volume <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span>.
      For backwards compatibility, multi-volume books are also supported by
      the entry type <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span>. However,
      it is advisable to make use of the dedicated entry type <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@mvbook</span>.
    mvcollection: A multi-volume <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>.
      For backwards compatibility, multi-volume collections are also supported
      by the entry type <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>.
      However, it is advisable to make use of the dedicated entry type <span
      weight="bold" face="monospace">@mvcollection</span>.
    online: An online resource. <span face="monospace">author</span>, <span
      face="monospace">editor</span>, and <span face="monospace">year</span>
      are omissible in terms of @@@cite{defaults.fields.doc.missing_and_omissible_data}.
      This entry type is intended for sources such as web sites which are
      intrinsically online resources. Note that all entry types support the
      <span face="monospace">url</span> field. For example, when adding an
      article from an online journal, it may be preferable to use the <span
      weight="bold" face="monospace">@article</span> type and its <span face="monospace">url</span>
      field.
    patent: A patent or patent request. The number or record token is given
      in the number field. Use the <span face="monospace">type</span> field
      to specify the type and the <span face="monospace">location</span> field
      to indicate the scope of the patent, if different from the scope implied
      by the <span face="monospace">type</span>. Note that the <span face="monospace">location</span>
      field is treated as a key list with this entry type, see @@@import{2.2.1}
      for details.
    performance: Musical and theatrical performances as well as other works
      of the performing arts. This type refers to the event as opposed to
      a recording, a score, or a printed play.
    periodical: An complete issue of a periodical, such as a special issue
      of a journal. The title of the periodical is given in the <span face="monospace">title</span>
      field. If the issue has its own title in addition to the main title
      of the periodical, it goes in the <span face="monospace">issuetitle</span>
      field. The <span face="monospace">editor</span> is omissible in terms
      of @@@cite{defaults.fields.doc.missing_and_omissible_data}.
    report: A technical report, research report, or white paper published
      by a university or some other institution. Use the <span face="monospace">type</span>
      field to specify the type of report. The sponsoring institution goes
      in the <span face="monospace">institution</span> field.
    review: Reviews of some other work. This is a more specific variant of
      the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@article</span> type. The standard
      styles will treat this entry type as an alias for <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@article</span>.
    software: Computer software.
    standard: National and international standards issued by a standards body
      such as the International Organization for Standardization.
    suppbook: Supplemental material in a <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span>.
      This type is closely related to the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      entry type. While <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      is primarily intended for a part of a book with its own title (e. g.,
      a single essay in a collection of essays by the same author), this type
      is provided for elements such as prefaces, introductions, forewords,
      afterwords, etc. which often have a generic title only. Style guides
      may require such items to be formatted differently from other <span
      weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span> items. The standard styles
      will treat this entry type as an alias for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>.
    suppcollection: Supplemental material in a <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>.
      This type is similar to <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@suppbook</span>
      but related to the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>
      entry type. The standard styles will treat this entry type as an alias
      for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@incollection</span>.
    suppperiodical: Supplemental material in a <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@periodical</span>.
      This type is similar to @suppbook but related to the <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@periodical</span> entry type. The role of this entry
      type may be more obvious if you bear in mind that the <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@article</span> type could also be called <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@inperiodical</span>. This type may be useful when
      referring to items such as regular columns, obituaries, letters to the
      editor, etc. which only have a generic title. Style guides may require
      such items to be formatted differently from articles in the strict sense
      of the word. The standard styles will treat this entry type as an alias
      for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@article</span>.
    thesis: A thesis written for an educational institution to satisfy the
      requirements for a degree. Use the <span face="monospace">type</span>
      field to specify the type of thesis.
    unpublished: A work with an author and a title which has not been formally
      published, such as a manuscript or the script of a talk. Use the fields
      <span face="monospace">howpublished</span> and <span face="monospace">note</span>
      to supply additional information in free format, if applicable.
    video: Audiovisual recordings, typically on dvd, vhs cassette, or similar
      media. See also <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@movie</span>.
